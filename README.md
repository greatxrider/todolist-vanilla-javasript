# Todo List - Vanilla JavaScript

This is a simple Todo List application built using Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, remove, and toggle tasks on their list.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd todo-list`
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- Click on the "Create" button to add a new task to the list.
- Click on the "Remove" button next to a task to delete it from the list.
- Click on the "Toggle" button to show or hide the task list.

## Code Explanation

The main functionality of the Todo List is implemented in the `app.js` file. Here are the key components:

- `btnCreate`: Represents the "Create" button that adds a new task to the list.
- `btnToggle`: Represents the "Toggle" button that shows or hides the task list.
- `btnRemove`: Represents the "Remove" button that deletes a task from the list.
- `taskList`: Represents the container element that holds the task list.
- `listItems`: Represents the individual task items in the list.

The code uses event listeners to handle user interactions. When a button is clicked, the corresponding action is performed, such as adding a new task, removing a task, or toggling the visibility of the task list.
